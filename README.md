#RogueLike by HFDrae

Hello !

Welcome on this project !

Here is my first attempt on coding a RogueLike ! 

Libraries used are : System-Hook by Kristian Kraljic;

More details upcoming...


Currently aborted, have to make it compatible with Linux and System-Hook is compatible only with Windows, so I have to start over everything movement related... 
Also have to restructure the project architecture that ain't very good (gotta learn a bit more)

Back on this project as soon as other for courses are finished...
